# Erc721



The `Erc721` class from the `@cod3x/openapi` package provides methods to interact with ERC-721 tokens.

### Initialization

To use the `Erc721` class, you need to create an instance of it by passing an instance of the `HttpClient` class to its constructor. The `HttpClient` class is also part of the `@cod3x/openapi` package and provides a convenient way to make HTTP requests.

Here's an example of how to create an instance of the `Erc721` class:

```javascript
import { HttpClient, Erc721 } from '@cod3x/openapi';

const http = new HttpClient({
  baseUrl: 'https://beta.usemoon.ai',
  securityWorker: async (securityData) => {
    return {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${securityData.token}`,
      },
    };
  },
});

const erc721 = new Erc721(http);
```

### Methods

The `Erc721` class provides the following methods:

1.  `approve(name: string, data: Erc721Request, params?: RequestParams): Promise<ApproveData>`

    * Approves a spender to transfer a specific token on behalf of the owner.

These methods can be used to perform various operations on ERC-721 tokens, such as checking token balances, approving spenders, transferring tokens, and more. The `Erc721` class is a part of the `@cod3x/openapi` package, which provides a convenient way to interact with the Moon API.

The `contract_address` and `token_id` properties are required for most of the `Erc721` class methods, as they are used to identify the specific ERC-721 token contract and token with which to interact. Without the `contract_address` and `token_id` properties, the method may not be able to correctly identify the token contract and token and may return incorrect results.
